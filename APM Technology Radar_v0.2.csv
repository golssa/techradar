Splunk IM,Assess,APM,FALSE,"<p>Increasingly, we see a mismatch between what data-driven organizations want to achieve and what the current data architectures and organizational structures allow. Organizations want to embed data-driven decision-making, machine learning and analytics into many aspects of their products and services and how they operate internally; essentially they want to augment every aspect of their operational landscape with data-driven intelligence. Yet, we still have a ways to go before we can embed analytical data, access to it and how it is managed into the business domains and operations. Today, every aspect of managing analytical data is externalized outside of the operational business domains to the data team and to the data management monoliths: data lakes and data warehouses. <strong><a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html"">Data mesh</a></strong> is a decentralized sociotechnical approach to remove the dichotomy of analytical data and business operation.

SignalFX,Hold,Infrastructure Monitoring,FALSE,<p>Used predominantly by FE teams for monitoring and alerting.</p>
Dynatrace,Hold,APM,FALSE,<p>Used by infra and retail. Highly recommended by ACN.</p>
CloudWatch,Hold,APM,FALSE,"<p>Since introducing them in the Radar in 2016, we've seen widespread adoption of <a href=""/radar/techniques/micro-frontends"">micro frontends</a> for web UIs. Recently, however, we've seen projects extend this architectural style to include <strong>micro frontends for mobile</strong> applications as well. When the application becomes sufficiently large and complex, it becomes necessary to distribute the development over multiple teams. This presents the challenge of maintaining team autonomy while integrating their work into a single app. Some teams write their own frameworks to enable this development style, and in the past we've mentioned <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/atlas-and-beehive"">Atlas and Beehive</a> as possible ways to simplify the problem of integrating multiteam app development. More recently, we've seen teams using <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-native"">React Native</a> to accomplish the same thing. Each React Native micro frontend is kept in its own repository where it can be built, tested and deployed separately. The team responsible for the overall application can then aggregate those micro frontends built by different teams into a single released app.</p>"
